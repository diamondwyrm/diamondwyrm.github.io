					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago I was a teaching assistant for a course called “Discrete Mathematics.” My job was to help the students understand the important concepts that they were required to master as part of the course. While there are many subsections of discrete structures, this particular class was focused on the mathematics needed for competent work in computer science. There are many subsections in the field of discrete structures but this class gave special attention to three key areas: mathematical reasoning, structures, and algorithmic thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous blogs I described key areas in which I taught such as mathematical reasoning and structures. In this brief blog I plan to address the third key area of teaching I did: algorithms.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more basic algorithms we taught to students was the binary search algorithm. This is one of the more important aspects of discrete structures and programming, albeit very basic. A binary search must begin with a sorted list/set. Once you have this you can conduct a binary search. To conduct a binary search you take your set divided in half and check the two values next to the split. You take the set that is closer to your value and repeat the technique until you find what you’re looking for, or the set is depleted. This is an important programming algorithm as it is the basis for searching large ordered data sets as efficiently as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important algorithm I had a chance to teach on was the bubble sort algorithm. This one goes in tandem with the previous algorithm, as it is one of the most basic ways to sort a set. The principal of the bubble sort is that you check a pair of entries to one another, starting with the first pair, then the second, and so on. Each checked pair is compared to each other and if the first should go after the second, then their places are to be switched. This algorithm is good in that it takes no more passes to complete than there are elements in the set, and is a great first step to understanding programming sorting loops.
