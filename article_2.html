					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago I was a teaching assistant for a course called “Discrete Mathematics.” My job was to help the students understand the important concepts that they were required to master as part of the course. While there are many subsections of discrete structures, this particular class was focused on the mathematics needed for competent work in computer science. There are many subsections in the field of discrete structures but this class gave special attention to three key areas: mathematical reasoning, structures, and algorithmic thinking.

				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last blog I gave a summary of some of the material I taught in the area of mathematical reasoning. In this blog I will go over the basics I taught in the area of structures.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more common structures in discrete mathematics, as discussed in my first blog, are sets. There are many types of sets, with the more important ones being infinite sets, finite sets, subsets, and power sets. Infinite sets and finite sets are pretty self-explanatory.  An infinite set is, obviously, infinite.  A good example is the set of all whole numbers.  A finite set, of course, is a limited set—a collection of entities such as the numbers {1, 2, 3}.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsets are also fairly common and something we normally learn in our first courses in basic math. A subset is simply any set that is properly contained within another set. For example, the set of all whole numbers is a subset of the set of rational numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “power set” is a more complex idea that students had to wrap their head around. Power sets are defined as a set of the subsets of a set (S)—and includes the whole set (S) and the empty set of S.  These kind of structures become very important in programming, especially when dealing with things such as JSON, lists, data frames, or other types of containers.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important structure is the sequence. Sequences are sets that can be represented through a function equation. That is to say the set {1, 3, 9, 27…} can be represented by 3n sequences also play an important role in dealing with summations, which are what happens when a function is applied to a set. It’s important to understand these kinds of details when working with loops in programming. Understanding these can help you avoid infinite loops and “hung” programs.
