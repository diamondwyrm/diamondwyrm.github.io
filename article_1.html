					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago I was a teaching assistant for a course called “Discrete Mathematics.” My job was to help the students understand the important concepts that they were required to master as part of the course. While there are many subsections of discrete structures, this particular class was focused on the mathematics needed for competent work in computer science. There are many subsections in the field of discrete structures but this class gave special attention to three key areas: mathematical reasoning, structures, and algorithmic thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start this blog series with a summary of some of the material I taught in the area of mathematical reasoning.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mathematical reasoning there is probably nothing more important than propositional logic, or, to put it in programmer terminology, Boolean statements. Boolean statements provide the foundation for programming logic.  For instance, even the most fundamental idea such as the logical law of non-contradiction must be stated clearly and employed properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <i>p</i> is true, then <i>not p (⇁ p)</i> is false
				</p>
				<p>
					There are also other basics in mathematical reasoning such as:
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the condition relying on both of two objects; “and” (∧)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the condition relying on one object or another; “or” (∨)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the condition relying on one object or another, but not both; “exclusive or” (⊕)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the concepts of on object relying on another, or “if-then”; “conditional statement”(→)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the concept of objects relying on each other; “bi-conditional statements” (↔)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a pleasure to see the lights go on in the students as they began to apprehend that with such concepts they were in possession of a set of rational tools and building blocks that could take them in countless directions of productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important area in mathematical reasoning that I was able to introduce the students to was set operations. The field of set operations can be especially useful in the area of data analytics (a field in which I have a special interest) since data analytics has so much to do with unions and intersections of sets.
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course one cannot forget about propositional logic when moving into set operations. And while the fundamentals of propositional logic still provides the foundation, in set operations we use the propositional logic in new and more complex ways. There are also a number of set identities, not unlike basic mathematical properties.  For example, there are rules to distribute sets that has a close resemblance to the way the distributive property works in basic math.
